# Hi — I'm Augusto 👋

Indie iOS dev, curious tinkerer, and UI nerd. I make apps that I actually use — like Loop (a simple, focuses podcast player) — and contribute to open tools like Mockit.

This repo contains my GitHub profile config, notes, and a few small projects.

## Projects

- Loop — Podcast Player
  - A lightweight, design-first podcast player I built for iPhone. Get it on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/br/app/loop-podcast-player/id6736364779?l

- Mockit
  - A macOS app for quickly mocking up interactions and flows. Check it out: https://mockit-app.framer.website/

## Tech I mess with

- Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine
- Kotlin, Java
- JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS
- SQL, MySQL
- C
